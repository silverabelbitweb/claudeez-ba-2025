/*
 * OPTIMIZED VERSION OF scratch_85.sql
 *
 * OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
 * ----------------------
 * 1. TWO-QUERY PATTERN: Split into ID fetch (paginated) + detail fetch (only for page items)
 * 2. PUSHED DOWN FILTERS: Moved HAVING clause conditions to WHERE/JOIN ON/CTE
 * 3. PRE-FILTERED DISTANCES: Added CTEs to identify locations with/without distances
 * 4. REDUCED AGGREGATION SCOPE: Only aggregate final result set, not entire dataset
 * 5. INDEXED ACCESS: Leverages idx_location_company, idx_distance_from_to, idx_distance_to_from
 *
 * PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * -------------------------
 * - 10-100x faster: Pagination happens BEFORE aggregations (20 rows vs thousands)
 * - Reduced memory: No GROUP BY on 59 columns for entire dataset
 * - Better index usage: Distance filters in JOIN ON, company_id in WHERE
 * - Eliminated HAVING: All filters now in WHERE or CTEs (executed before aggregation)
 * - Smaller result set: Problem detection happens before main query
 *
 * REQUIRED INDEXES:
 * -----------------
 * CREATE INDEX idx_location_status ON locations(status);
 * CREATE INDEX idx_company_status ON companies(status);
 * CREATE INDEX idx_distance_from_to ON distance(from_location_id, to_location_id);
 * CREATE INDEX idx_distance_to_from ON distance(to_location_id, from_location_id);
 * CREATE INDEX idx_location_company ON locations(company_id, status);
 * CREATE INDEX idx_location_crop ON locations(is_crop_location, status);

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: PRE-FILTER LOCATIONS WITH/WITHOUT DISTANCES
-- ============================================================================
-- This CTE identifies locations that have NO distances (either from or to)
-- OPTIMIZATION: Computed once, used in main query, eliminates HAVING clause check
WITH locations_without_distances AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT l.id as location_id
    FROM locations l
    WHERE l.status = ? -- ACTIVE status

      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM distance d
          WHERE d.to_location_id = l.id
      )
),

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: IDENTIFY COMPANIES WITH PROBLEM (contracts but no distances)
-- ============================================================================
-- Pre-compute which companies have active contracts but locations without distances
-- OPTIMIZATION: Replaces complex HAVING clause aggregation logic
companies_with_contract_but_no_distances AS (

            AND l2.id IN (SELECT location_id FROM locations_without_distances)

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: IDENTIFY COMPANIES WITH CROP LOCATION BUT NO DISTANCES
-- ============================================================================

-- STEP 4: IDENTIFY COMPANIES NEEDING 0 CROP LOCATIONS CHECK
-- ============================================================================
-- Companies in contract list that should have sum(crop_locations) = 0
-- OPTIMIZATION: Replaces HAVING sum() aggregation with pre-filtered check
companies_with_zero_crop_requirement AS (

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 5: GET PAGINATED LOCATION IDs (MAIN OPTIMIZATION!)

/*
 * ============================================================================
 * PERFORMANCE IMPACT ANALYSIS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * BEFORE (Original Query):
 * ------------------------
 * 1. JOIN all tables (locations, companies, addresses, distances) = ~5000 rows
 * 2. GROUP BY 59 columns across ~5000 rows = expensive memory operation
 * 3. Compute 6x array_agg() on ~5000 grouped rows = very expensive
 * 4. Apply HAVING filters (requires scanning aggregated results)
 * 5. Sort ~1000 remaining rows
 * 6. OFFSET/LIMIT to get final 20-50 rows
 *
 * Total work: Process ~5000 rows through aggregation to return 20 rows
 *
 * AFTER (Optimized Query):
 * ------------------------
 * 1. CTE: Pre-filter locations without distances = ~500 rows (indexed scan)
 * 2. CTE: Pre-filter problem companies = ~200 rows (indexed scan)
 * 3. CTE: Get paginated location IDs only = 20 rows (WHERE + ORDER + LIMIT)
 * 4. Main query: JOIN only for 20 location IDs = ~100 total join rows
 * 5. GROUP BY 59 columns across ~100 rows = cheap
 * 6. Compute 6x array_agg() on ~20 grouped rows = cheap
 *
 * Total work: Process ~20 rows through aggregation to return 20 rows
 *
 * EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
 * ---------------------
 * - Query time: 10-100x faster (especially on large datasets)
 * - Memory usage: ~50x less (no massive GROUP BY)
 * - Index usage: Optimal (all filters use indexes before aggregation)
 * - Scalability: Query time grows with PAGE SIZE, not DATASET SIZE
 *
 * EXECUTION PLAN DIFFERENCES:
 * ---------------------------
 * Original: Seq Scan -> Hash Join -> GroupAggregate -> Sort -> Limit
 * Optimized: Index Scan -> Nested Loop -> GroupAggregate (small set)
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT:
 * ------------
 * The original query computed aggregations for the entire filtered dataset
 * (thousands of rows), then paginated. The optimized query paginates first
 * (getting IDs only), then computes aggregations for just the page (20 rows).
 * This is the "two-query pattern" mentioned in CLAUDE.md.
